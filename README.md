WEBSTACK-PROJECT-PORTFOLIO FINAL

This is a readme for the end project of my SE journey at ALX
____________________________________________________________

Our application at full capacity should be a management application for a small store, boutique, or supermarket.

to run it you have to install dependencies:
	to install them run: 
npm init -y
npm install bcrypt csv-parser dotenv express mongodb multer nodemon sha1 uuid

this dependencies assist to run the code, for example bcrypt will be used to encrypt the password, melter to handle file upload and so on.

We have our app.js file that runs the whole routes.

We have our routes directory that set and import all routes to be used.
We have storage modules to handle the DB connection.
We have users modules to handle users creation.

The users for this store are of 2 types:
_______________________________________

Administrator (manager of the store), in charge of the store overall.

some of what he can do in oou app are: 
	Create cashier users, 
	Upload the new stock itemâ€¦
	Edit the wrong caption of the cashiers 

Cashier users will be able to sell:
	Cashier can sell by reducing quantity of an item in numbers
	To edit item for the cashier is not possible.
